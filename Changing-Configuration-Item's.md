## Configuration
Changing config options is extremely simple and designed to make customization easier. So if you don't like something **disable it!**

You can change config options by opening the `config.json` file in the source folder (provided you git cloned or downloaded the source first)

Once the `config.json` file is opened you'll be greated with a ton of options followed by `true` or `false` statements, that is how we control the options so if you want to enable or disable something replace it with the `true` or `false` statements accordingly.

Once finished setting your options recompile and install the app that should be dropped in the `/dist` folder in the source directory.
